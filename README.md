This is a *pseudo-cms* tu build an html structure as fast as posssible

## Why did i said pseudo CMS
I was annoyed by the fact that cms didn't let you enough freedom for your creativity or were simpely too heavy so this tools just help you to generate the html *structure* of your website and then you can get the source code and just build the most creative website you want from it.
